# How to use "Determine Sample Size" Python script 

### Key Concepts to Consider
1. Confidence Level: The probability of NOT making Type 1 error, in other words, rejecting a null hypothesis when it's true. 
Generally, the most commonly used values for confidence level in sampling are 0.90 and 0.95.

2. Statistical Power: The probability of finding a statistically significnat result when a null hypothesis is false. 

Both confidence level and statistical power are a measure of sensitivity.
